  <h1>JOEL HARRRIS (BRACKISH DJ)</h1>
  <p>I can't stand coding!!! </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fonts don't change no matter what approach I try</li>
    <li>I've been working on this for 15 hours and this is as far as I got</li>
    <li>Did I mention that I hate coding?</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>JAMES MARSHALL (CODE-HATER)</h2>
  <p>I thought it would be cool to put together a little site to support my Twitch cast.</p>
  <p>I thouroughly regret that decision</p>
  <h3>Did I not get a memo?</h3>
  <p>I blatently stole this lay-out from the type exercise we did last week because I was tired of sitting in front of this computer. I feel like I must have missed a memo or something because it's 8:30pm on July 3rd and no one has posted on the discussion board yet.</p>
  <h4>Yup this is a 4th headline</h4>
    <p>I'm adding this 4th segment because IT IS 4th of July weekend. Not like anybody is reading this but "'Merica!!"</p>
    <p>I suspect that I have to fill this page with type to get the whole image of the Cyclops so I'm just gonna keep typing </p> 
    <p> until it works. I'm probably going to try and change the font color so you can actually read this, but based on the</p>
    <p>results I've had trying to just change the font, you're probably reading black print right now.</p>
